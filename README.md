[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jessgusclark/gadget-event-tracking.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jessgusclark/gadget-event-tracking)

An OUCampus gadget that allows content authors to insert a link with a Google event attached to it. 

## Gadget Preview
![Preview of the Event Tracking Gadget](https://jessgusclark.github.io/gadget-event-tracking/build/img/preview.jpg)

## Google Code:

The final code that is inserted into the page looks like this:

```
<a href="http://www.google.com" class="gtmclick"
		onclick="ga('send', {hitType: 'event',
        	eventCategory: 'link',
        	eventAction: 'click',
        	eventLabel: 'google'
         });">Google!</a>
```

Code is based off of analytics.js tracking. [More information on Google's Event Tracking here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/events). If you are running an older version of Google Analytics, this gadget will not work.

## Test the link

To test if the Google event fires, publish out the page and click on the link. Next in Google Analytics, navigate to the “Real-Time”/”Events” and see if the Event Category and Action happened. 

## Google Tag Manager

This code will not trigger events when the pageview is created via Google Tag Manager. To 'fix' this, the class of `gtmclick` has been added to the link. In Google Tag Manager, a trigger should be created to capture clicks with a class of `gtmclick`.
